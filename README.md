    - note: Unclear how reliable this is. If html edits seem unresponsive, then stop and start the vscode extension again.

## Where you should edit
- styles/*.scss
- index.pug

## Where you should NOT edit
- *.html
- styles/*.css
You can edit these if absolutely necessary but if you ever edit in the scss or pug files later they will overwrite these files.
